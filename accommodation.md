# Accommodation Suggestions

Accommodation in Edinburgh in August is *very* hard to get and can be very expensive, so book early.
Here are two options that we have reserved for you and that we recommend.

- [Braid Hills Hotel](http://www.braidhillshotel.co.uk/). Must be
  contacted direct to make the reservation for the discounted rooms. When
  booking, you must state that you want to book a room from the
  ``Royal Observatory block booking and the reference number:
  BHH67597''. A credit or debit card will be require to make and
  secure each reservation. No bookings will be accepted after the 07th
  July 2019.

- Student Castle, Causewayside. We have 35 rooms set aside for the
meeting, for four nights, 5th - 9th August, that's 4 nights. 20 of
these rooms have an option for the fifth night, e.g. the Sunday 4th
August. Note, the Student Castle rooms are self-catering. 
Contact

  several options
