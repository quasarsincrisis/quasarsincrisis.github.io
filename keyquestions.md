# Key Questions
 - What is the Broad Line Region? 
 - What is the Narrow Line Region?
 - Torus which is not strictly speaking a torus, but what else can we call it given     the planar geometry? We already have a disk. What about making it an acronym: "The Obscuring Region of the Unified Scheme"?
 - What IS the fraction of obscured and Compton Thick AGN?
 - How related are the optical and X-ray obscuring media?
 - What is the difference between quasars and blazars?
 - Can we reduce our AGN taxonomy to a more useful, smaller set?
 - How do we properly account for multi-wavelength obscuration in AGN population studies?
 - Why are only ~10% of AGN radio-loud?
 - Which AGN parameters dominate the dispersion in observational properties of AGN?
 - What is the origin of the soft X-ray excess/UV downturn?
 - Why do disks look different at 0.2LEdd in AGN (big Soft X-ray ex cess/UV downturn) than in Binaries (something that looks and varies like a Shakura-Sunyaev disc!)
 - At around Eddington the NLS1 do look like a disc - but why are there discs in AGN when they are radiation pressure unstable?
 - Why are there discs in black hole binaries since they are radiation pressure unstable too (just not quite so badly as AGN!)
 - How do we make discs vary? The NLS1 have optical/UV that change on timescales of weeks-months yet this can't be reprocessing as the x-rays are weak.
 - How badly has Cloudy misled the AGN field?
 - Do any supermassive black holes accrete super-critically?
 - Is the Soltan Argument wrong? Are we missing significant accretion in the Universe?
 - Is the physics of accretion redshift dependent? 
 - Are Warm Absorbers seen in X-rays due to a thermal wind from the torus?
