# Visiting Edinburgh

If you google "Visit Edinburgh" you will get far more than you need. However the Edinburgh section of [Visit Scotland website](https://www.visitscotland.com/destinations-maps/edinburgh-lothians/) is pretty good, and Visit Scotland in general is good if you are planning a Scootish holiday before or after the meeting. The Edinburgh section of  [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/edinburgh) is also reliable, and Lonely Planet has a really nice phone app.

If you don't want to wear out shoe leather or spend all your money on taxis, Edinburgh has a good bus system. The web page is [here](https://www.lothianbuses.com) but what you really want to do is download the *Transport for Edinburgh* phone app. It knows the time to the next bus from nearby bus stops, and is pretty accurate. There is a fixed exact fare per ride of Â£1.70, but also day tickets, and you can load multiple tickets onto your phone, as explained [here](https://www.lothianbuses.com/tickets/)

The buses that stop at the foot of Blackford Hill are 24, 38 and 41. (Nothing goes to the stop of the hill unfortunately!) The 41 is very handy for going into town and is every 15 minutes.
