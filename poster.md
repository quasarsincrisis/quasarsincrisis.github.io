___

The Quasars in Crisis team have elected to go for 'e-poster' session(s) for this meeting. All submitted posters will be hosted here for your perusal both before, during and after the meeting.

Above every poster image will be a direct download link for the submitted pdf. In the interests of space, posters with more than one slide will only have their initial slide shown here.

Enjoy!
