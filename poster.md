# e-posters

The Quasars in Crisis team have elected to go for 'e-poster' session(s) for this meeting. All submitted posters will be hosted here for your perusal both before, during and after the meeting. Below every poster image will be a direct download link to the original pdf. Posters with more than one slide will only have their initial slide shown here.

For guidelines, templates and submission instructions please head here: [Guidelines for submission](posterPrep.md)
