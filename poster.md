# e-posters 

The Quasars in Crisis team have elected to go for 'e-posters', in the form of three-page mini-slide-shows.

* The front page of each e-poster will be displayed in the web page below for your perusal before, during and after the meeting.

* If you click on the link, you get all three pages.

* The front pages will also cycle through on several display screens during the breaks

* The front page will also be what you should use in the programmed "poster talks" sessions.

 
## For poster guidelines, templates and submission instructions please head here: [Guidelines for submission](posterPrep)

Enjoy!
