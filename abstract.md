# Abstract Submission

Abstracts for talks and poster slots are encouraged and welcome at
this time. Friday 22nd March 2019 is the Abstract Submission
Deadline.

The talks will be scheduled to be 15 minutes in length, with this not
including questions or discussion. We are aiming to have `electronic
posters', so that posters are displayed on large format screens
(rather than having to print out and transport large sheets of paper).

For Submission please send a 150 word or less Abstract to:

[QuasarsInCrisis@gmail.com](mailto:quasarsincrisis@gmail.com)

giving your name, career stage and presentation/poster preference.
